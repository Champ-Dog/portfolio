# Portfolio

This is a portfolio website I am developing (or will have developed, if you read this in the future) for my portfolio assessment at Coder Academy.
More details will be included here as work continues.

25/2/22
Currently project should include basic HTML shells for the four pages of the website. 
Am working on layout and some initial styling for mobile. 


README document
General project documentation is to be compiled as a single markdown file named README.md. This file should contain,

A link (URL) to your published portfolio website
A link to your GitHub repo
Description of your portfolio website, including,
Purpose
Functionality / features
Sitemap
Screenshots
Target audience
Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)

# Portfolio Website
This repo contains the code and other assets used to build my portfolio site.

The repository for this project can be found here:
https://github.com/Champ-Dog/portfolio


The website itself can be found here:   
https://champ-dog.github.io/portfolio

## General Description + Purpose
This website will function as a digital business card, resume, and first point of contact. The expected audience includes professional contacts, potential employers, and clients.

As well as conveying a sense of who I am, the site should provide relevant personal and professional information, showcase my technical skills, and direct users to where they can follow or contact me.

Going forward, I also intend to use the site as a platform to share blog posts and video content.

## Technical Description
The website consists of four seperate pages. Each has it's own `.html` file, and a linked `.css` file for individual layout and styling. There is a seperate `style.css` file for universal styling across all pages.

This project was built with these technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git
- GitHub
- GitHub Pages

Included in the repo for this project should be:
### src directory
- 4 `.html` files, one for each of the four pages of the website
- 5 `.css` files, containing layout and style instructions for the pages.
- An images directory, containing the images used in the website
- A `.pdf` file containing a mock-up resume (to be updated)
- 1 `README.md` file (you found it!) describing the project
- Sitemap files

- A docs directory, containing the content linked to by this document
- 

## Features
The website contains four pages:

### Landing Page
A landing page to greet the user, invite them to explore the site, and provide navigation. This page focuses on an image of myself, to create a personal and inviting feeling.

### About Me
This page contains a brief introduction to me, my interests, and professional history. This page will provde links to my resume, blog, and YouTube channel/s. The links are in the form of visual icons, which are animated to attract attention and engage the user.

### Blog
This is a blog page, initially containing filler text. Going forward my plan is to fill this with existing and future writing. Currently content is included in the `.html` document for this page; I plan to restructure this page to allow linking to external or included files. This should minimise the need to edit the base code for the page when new content is added.  
As well as the actual content of the blog posts, this page also includes a navbar, allowing the user to navigate directly to a specific post.

### Contact
A contact page, which will invite the user to follow my professional accounts and other projects, and contact me directly. This page includes the same image as the landing page, adding a personal touch to the invitation to connect. This page mirrors the layout of the landing page, to give a sense of framing the site.

Each page also contains a navbar, allowing the user to access the other pages.

## Sitemap

This is a fairly small webpage, and the layout is straightforward. There is a landing page `index.html` that links directly to each other page. Each page contains a navbar allowing access to each other page.

## Notes
The current visual layout differs notably from the initial wireframe of the site. Initial design contained unnecessary complexity, and layouts that were not functional with the final content of the site.

In creating initial designs and wireframes, I overestimated the amount of visual 'real estate' I would have on various devices (notably tablets). I also overvalued interesting or novel displays without sufficient knowledge or consideration of the end-user experience.

This resulted in significant extra work both in coding, and then needing to overhaul designs and code partway through the project. Initial designs introduced complexity and visual "busy-ness" without a commensurate increase in value, meaning, or accessibility for the end-user.

My technical skills and understanding were challenged, especially regarding the layout and manipulation of elements in HTML and CSS. This project highlighted significant gaps in my knowledge and understanding, and required a significant shift in my perception of how an object appears to me as a human vs. how it would appear to a computer.

On a personal level, this project has also highlighted some issues in my approach to learning generally; as well as forcing me to consider how to apply hard-won problem-solving skills from my prior career into a new field.
