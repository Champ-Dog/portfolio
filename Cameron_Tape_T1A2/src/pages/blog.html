                <p>One of the more common mistakes I've seen baristas make is hastily changing several variables when dialling in or correcting a brew. I was often told "grind finer, and tamp lighter" and similar when I was taught to make coffee. "Grind coarser and change the dose" was a go-to for a more recent colleague. I've seen these responses in every workplace and class I've been in; from both new and experienced baristas. I do it myself, more often than I care to admit.</p><br />
                <p>The problem with this approach is that you won't know which change you made did what. Even if you get the result you wanted, you can't be sure why. I know first-hand how confusing this can be when you're new. I spent years confused, uncertain, and seeing coffee as some kind of dark magic that I couldn't master. I was instructed to change several things, so I did. This made it hard to understand what any of these variables had an impact on; or why changes to different variables could often lead to similar results in the cup.</p><br />
                <p>It took years for this to change for me. A friend taught me a system based around standardising my dose (or at least an approximation, in a time before automatic grinders or scales were commonplace). For the first time, I was able to produce predictable results. By keeping one variable (relatively) consistent, I could respond to changes in a way that felt more rational and controlled.</p><br />
                <p>I improved more as a barista in the following months than I had in the preceding years. Problems I would struggle with for hours, and never really understand, could be resolved in minutes. If a change didn't work, I knew what I had changed and could change it back. I could start to notice that changing a particular variable a certain way would typically have a similar outcome. I started to understand, and actually learn.</p><br />
                <p>That was all years ago, of course. This is important when you're learning; but you and I are old hands at this. We can take shortcuts. We're experienced, we have a bunch of contextual information - we know this coffee, this equipment, what our customers like. We really can save a lot of time and energy like this! Still, when I'm feeling confused, stressed, or approaching a new coffee, I'll often remind myself - one thing at a time.</p><br />

                <h3>What I’ve Learned from Manual Routing</h3>
                <h4>Cameron Tape</h4>
                <h4>May 2022</h4><br />
                <p>I’m currently enrolled in a web development course. The most recent assessment task was to create a two-sided marketplace application using Ruby on Rails. We covered Rails in class, I’d read a bunch of guides, and made some simpler practice apps. I was good to go!</p>
                <p>There wasn’t a lot of time for this assignment, so I made use of Rails’ resources routing shortcut for Profiles, and again for nesting Addresses in Profiles. My routes looked like:</p><br />
                <p>
                    <pre>
                    resources :profiles do
                      resources :addresses
                    end
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>This was working okay for me, but I was running into a few problems with links that I didn’t really understand. I also needed to use Devise for User accounts (we’d been strongly encouraged to introduce Profiles separately rather than expanding Devise’s User class to avoid breaking anything needed for security). I wanted the Profile information to be nested in the User sign-up; and went straight back to what I knew:</p><br />
                <p>
                    <pre>
                        resources :users do
                          resources :profiles do
                            resources :addresses
                          end
                        end
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>Every other link and button in my app broke. When I fixed one problem, another would arise — usually for the same link! I spent days trying to fix this; but I couldn’t make any headway. I eventually reached out for help to an instructor — I was halfway through my assessment period and wasn’t much further along than day one!</p><br />
                <p>My instructor spent about two minutes looking at my code and sent back a screenshot of my routes, asking “Do you understand what’s going on here?” He suggested I re-write all my routes manually. I was predictably demoralised: I’d already lost a lot of time trying to solve problems, now I had to go back re-do work in a way that would take even longer.</p><br />
                <p>This ended up being a remarkably positive experience! Besides eliminating a huge chunk of unnecessary routes, it helped me sort out all the problems I was having. A lot of my issues with links not working (or displaying) were from expecting the wrong params. I knew how to use params, of course; but I didn’t really understand params. Constructing my routes manually forced me to think about what params I was passing, and when, and how I wanted to use them.</p><br />
                <p>Using the resources shortcuts, and nesting them as I had, meant my paths were often convoluted, and passing along more information than was necessary. I hadn’t really understood this, and as someone super fresh at Rails, I couldn’t manage it properly to get the information I needed. I hadn’t understood that this was something I controlled.</p><br />
                <p>Even though it took a extra time that I didn’t feel I had, I learned a lot in the day or two it took to re-work my app. It gave me a chance to cement my understanding of routes, and to begin to understand params. I was able to fix the recurring problems I was having and solve future issues faster.</p><br />
                <p>More importantly, it reminded me that the point of what I was doing was to learn, even if it took me a bit longer. Trying to learn unfamiliar skills can be daunting, but small wins like this are moments of respite that help me keep going.</p><br />
