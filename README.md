This is a portfolio website I am developing (or will have developed, if you read this in the future) for my portfolio assessment at Coder Academy.
More details will be included here as work continues.

Currently project should include basic HTML shells for the four pages of the website. 
Am working on layout and some initial styling for mobile.
