After a career fretting over minute details, myriad variables, and personal preferences held as inalienable truths; I thought I'd give myself a break and get into coding! You probably don't know whether I'm joking right now, or to what degree. That feeling is probably the best introduction I could give you. That's me.</div>

            <div class="blurb">I'm really into gaming. Games can be shared storytelling in a world you help to shape. Sometimes they're puzzles: testing your problem solving and logic skills through tactical decisions in a responsive environment. Sometimes they're lessons in resource management, cost-benefit analysis, or teamwork and leadership. Some are learning tools for people who understand reward and motivation. Sometimes it's all about the people - I play card games in tabletop when we're not in a pandemic. I run a small YouTube channel focused on gaming, and just started another for my tech interests.</div>

            <div class="blurb">I've been working with coffee for 15 years. I've done at least a little bit of everything: floor, serving, dishes, kitchen, coffee, managing, training, roasting. I've led a few teams, helped with and hosted a few events, and worked with and for some of the best coffee minds in Sydney. I have a Diploma in Hospitality Management, and I've done some learning in performance management, digital security, and communication and presentation skills. Overall, I've found the people to be more interesting than the coffee; although as someone who isn't naturally extroverted it's nice to have a big coffee machine to hide behind sometimes! Working in cafes has taught me the importance of continuous improvement, lifelong learning, and documentation. That last one might seem odd - there's a blog post about it later.</div>
